# the teachingRSE project

This is a working group of [de-RSE e.V.](https://de-rse.org/)
and the joint ['Fachgruppe RSE'](https://fg-rse.gi.de/) of the
Gesellschaft f√ºr Informatik e.V. (GI, German Informatics Society).

We are generally working towards improving the teaching of RSE-related topics.
Currently, we are developing a set of guidelines for the best development
of young and practising RSEs.

If you want to contact us you can either write an issue on the respective repository
or for more general inquiries an email to jmu-teachingrse@listserv.dfn.de

  (Position paper 002 of de-RSE e.V.)
- A [collection of helpful ressources](https://de-rse.org/learn-and-teach/)
